# Comprehensive Forecasting System with User Interface for Multiple Sectors

## Objective
The Comprehensive Forecasting System aims to develop a versatile platform for implementing and comparing various time series models across different sectors. It provides users with a user-friendly interface for visualizing data and forecasts.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing
### Data Sources
- Finance Sector: Monthly stock prices from the S&P 500 index.
- Energy Sector: Hourly energy consumption data.
- Environmental Sector: Daily atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values.
2. **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale the data uniformly.
3. **Stationarization**: Apply differencing and logarithmic transformations as needed to achieve stationarity.

## Tools and Technologies
1. **Backend**: Python with Flask for server-side logic.
2. **Frontend**: ReactJS for dynamic and responsive UI, HTML/CSS for layout.
3. **Data Science**: Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Database**: SQLite for storing processed data and results.
5. **Version Control**: Git for code management.

## Model Development
### ARIMA Configuration and Tuning
- Identify order of differencing, autoregressive terms, and lagged forecast errors using statistical tests.
### ANN Design and Training
- Design neural networks with varying architectures and implement backpropagation for training.
### SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, SVR, LSTM
- Customize models for specific characteristics of the data.
### Hybrid Models Integration
- Combine ARIMA and ANN models to enhance forecast accuracy.

## Frontend Development
### Interface Design
- Design intuitive UI with dropdowns for dataset selection and buttons for executing forecasts.
### Visualization Tools
- Implement interactive charts and graphs for effective data presentation.
### Interactive Dashboard
- Enable users to select models, view graphs, compare results, and upload new data for retraining.

## Testing and Validation
### Model Testing
- Validate predictions using historical data and assess performance with cross-validation.
### System Testing
- Conduct unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and API reliability.

## Deployment
### Application Deployment
- Deploy the application to a scalable platform for accessibility.

## Deliverables
1. **Full System Documentation**: Covers all aspects from data processing to UI design.
2. **Working Application**: Fully functional web-based forecasting system.
3. **Presentation and Demo**: Detailed presentation with live demo for review.
4. **Source Code**: Accessible on GitHub with individual contributions documented.

## Important Notes
1. **Individual Contributions**: Each team member must document their contributions.
2. **Deadline Adherence**: Adhere to the two-week deadline for timely submissions.
3. **GitHub Hosting**: All project files must be hosted on GitHub.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Final score based on the accuracy of the hybrid neural network.
